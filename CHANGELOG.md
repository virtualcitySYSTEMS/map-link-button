# v1.0.3

- Fixes bug where the `LinkButtonConfigEditor` created an invalid config, since name was missing.
- Add Notification if button with same title already exists and therefore is not added.

# v1.0.2

- Fixes bug that made it impossible to add a first button with the editor if there is not at least an empty array for `buttons` in the config.
